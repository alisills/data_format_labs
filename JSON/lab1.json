    You are given the following mixed dataset: 

    EmployeeID: 101,   

    EmployeeName: "Sathwik",   

    IsActive: true,   

    JoiningDate: 11-SEP-2025,   

    Salary: 50,00 INR 

    1. Identify data types of each value. 

    2. Convert the above dataset into a valid JSON format. 

    3. Explain why JSON is considered a data format rather than a data type. 

    4. Create a nested JSON version by adding "Address" (with "City", "State", "PinCode") inside the JSON.  

    5. Point out one invalid JSON representation for this dataset and correct it. 

    6. Justify why JSON is widely used in real-world applications for such data. "
